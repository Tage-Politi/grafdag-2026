Our purpose in writing this book is to provide a gentle introduction to a subject
that is enjoying a surge in interest. We believe that the subject is fascinating in its
own right, but the increase in interest can be attributed to several factors. One factor
is the realization that networks are “everywhere”. From social networks such
as Facebook, the World Wide Web and the Internet to the complex interactions
between proteins in the cells of our bodies, we face the challenge of understanding
their structure and development. By and large natural networks grow in an
unpredictable manner and this is often modeled by a random construction. Another
factor is the realization by Computer Scientists that NP-hard problems are
often easier to solve than their worst-case suggests and that an analysis of running
times on random instances can be informative.
